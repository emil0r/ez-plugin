```clojure
[ez-plugin "0.1.0"]
```

== Usage

. Library to be loaded as a plugin
. An EDN file in the file path (for example in resources)
.. The EDN file can be named anything
.. If placed in the root of resources, the path is the file name
. You run the following code

```clojure
(require '[ez-plugin.core :as plugin])
(plugin/load-plugins "plugin.edn" {})
```

The EDN file must look like this. The hooks specified as a vector with the fully qualifed path to the functions you wish to call. The context map is passed as an argument to the function.

``clojure
{:ez-plugin/hooks [ez-plugin-test1.core/hook]}
```
